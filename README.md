# LDAP Example Project

Welcome to LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) example project! This project demonstrates how to set up and use LDAP to secure a simple Spring Boot application. 

## Introduction

LDAP is a protocol used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over a network. It is widely used for managing user credentials, organizational information, and access control. This project provides a practical example of how to implement LDAP security in a Spring Boot application.

## Project Overview

This example project is divided into two parts:
1. **Initial Helloworld Website**: A simple Spring Boot application without any security.
2. **Secured Helloworld Project**: The same application secured using LDAP.

## Deployment Instructions

### Downloading and Running the LDAP Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files from the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/poojamothukuri/LDAP-Example.git
    ```

2. **Open the Project in Your Favorite IDE**:
    - **Eclipse**: 
        - File > Import > Existing Maven Projects > Select the cloned directory > Finish.
    - **IntelliJ IDEA**: 
        - File > Open > Select the cloned directory > Open as Project.
    - **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**: 
        - File > Import > Existing Maven Projects > Select the cloned directory > Finish.

3. **Build the Project**:
    - Ensure that you have Maven installed. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the Initial Helloworld Project**:
    - In your IDE, locate the main application file for the initial Helloworld project (e.g., `InitialHelloworldApplication.java`) and run it. This will start the simple Spring Boot application without security.

5. **Run the Secured Helloworld Project**:
    - In your IDE, locate the main application file for the secured Helloworld project (e.g., `SecuredHelloworldApplication.java`) and run it. This will start the Spring Boot application secured with LDAP.

### Testing Security Features

1. **Access the Secured Application**: 
    - Use a web browser to access the secured application. You will be prompted to log in using LDAP credentials.

2. **LDAP Configuration**:
    - The application is configured to use an LDAP server for authentication. Ensure your LDAP server is running and properly configured.
    - Configure the LDAP connection details in the `application.properties` file of the secured project.

3. **Perform Operations**:
    - **Login**: Attempt to log in with valid LDAP credentials.
    - **Access Secured Endpoints**: Try to access secured endpoints to see how access controls are enforced.

4. **Review Security Logs**: Check the logs generated by the application to understand how security events are logged and monitored.
